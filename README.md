# NMEA0183 Decoder

The repository decode AIS as well GPS messages of NMEA0183 protocol. The previous NMEA 0183 Sentence Reader felt a bit incomplete, so I made new one and added it to my AIS decoder. Now the package provides full functionality in decoding both AIS and GPS messages from an NMEA AIS device. Not all the GPS messages are implemented as I did not encounter them. Will add them if needed.
Refer to runExample.m for usage.
